/* TODO: SUS EDITION
 * this is a list of sus things!
 * 
 * if you try
 * @Override
 * public FileReader
 * 
 * it appears to accept "FileReader"...
 * If this is what I think it is, can we lie to specifically and only RaycastContext.class, our "FileReader"?
 * If so, can we tell it our CollisionShapes and OutlineShapes are empty?
 * (I just don't want to have to deal with this anymore. I just don't. It's SO annoying that some Mojang employee made
 * "one mistake that doesn't matter" and now it's OUR PROBLEM because THEIR BOSS THINKS IT'S FINE!
 * I am going LITERALLY INSANE over the INABILITY to just UNDERSTAND what CERTAIN pieces of code even MEAN and ALREADY THINKING
 * I know the SOLUTION to the PROBLEM!)
