 * TODO:
 * 
 * If there is a number before a to-do list item, that is its priority. 1 is
 * highest, oo is lowest.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Making other mods:
 * Make other mods, such as Better Sweeping, Crit Overhaul, More Bows, More
 * Arrows, More Shields,
 * Terrarian Weather, Better Time, and Shockwaves.
 * 
 * Better Sweeping is probably possible
 * Crit Overhaul might be possible
 * More Bows is probably possible
 * More Arrows is probably possible
 * More Shields is definitely possible (copy+paste old mod then add axe nerf,
 * and add credit to original mod)
 * Terrarian Weather might be possible
 * Better Time is probably possible
 * Shockwaves is probably possible
 * 
 * Spin Attack will make a keybind for an AoE cooldown attack that only works if
 * you have a sword, and depends on the sword's damage.
 * Spin Attack will also need new animations (spinning animation and spin attack
 * slashes) and a cooldown bar.
 * (When the cooldown is active, the XP bar is replaced by a red XP bar that
 * shows how much time is left until the cooldown is over,
 * and replaces the level display with a spin attack icon.)
 * 
 * Priceless Dash will make a keybind for a dash with a cooldown. (5 second
 * cooldown) The dash will go about 2 blocks.
 * The reason it is called "Priceless" Dash is because it is extremely good and
 * does not cost you anything to have dash.
 * By "cost" I mean... *being slowed down in warm biomes with 14 HP instead of
 * 20 HP, not being able to sprint, and/or being in
 * Forge 1.12.2/RLCraft just to be able to dodge intensifies*
 * 
 * Better Sweeping will increase the range and damage of the sweeping attack,
 * will increase the chance of getting the enchantment
 * Sweeping Edge, and will add an enchantment called "Air Slash" that gives you
 * a 5% chance shoot an air slash projectile that
 * goes 4 blocks (level 1) 5.5 blocks (level 2) and 7 blocks (level 3) when
 * doing a sweeping attack. When paired with Spin Attack,
 * doing a Spin Attack will have a 5% chance to shoot out 4 Air Slash
 * projectiles in a randomly rotated cross pattern.
 * 
 * Crit Overhaul will remove the jump attack crit from minecraft and add a crit
 * chance, defaulting to 10%. Crit chance can
 * be increased with weapon tier, as a way to rubber-band players and make them
 * stop craving Netherite. (Wood by 2.5%,
 * Gold by 15%, Stone by 3.75%, Iron by 12.5%, Diamond by 10%, Netherite by
 * 8.75%.)
 * 
 * More Bows will add Iron, Gold, Diamond, and Netherite reinforced bows.
 * (smithing table with normal bow to make Iron, Gold, and
 * Diamond bows.)
 * 
 * More Arrows will add Iron, Gold, and Flaming Arrows. (crafted with a nugget
 * or torch, not flint.)
 * (adds a new recipe for arrows, replacing flint with cobblestone.)
 * 
 * More Shields will add Wooden, Iron, Diamond, Golden, and Netherite shields,
 * along with reducing the shield cooldown for axes by 50%.
 * 
 * Terrarian Weather will tweak the chances of different types of weather in the
 * weather cycle,
 * as well as adding Windy Days, Blizzards, Storms, and Sandstorms from
 * Terraria.
 * Blizzards
 * Blizzards will reduce the light level provided by the sun by 3, spawn 2 new
 * mob types, (Frost Husk and Cryoarachnid)
 * and adds snow particles that fall from the sky and drift a little, But they
 * can only happen in snowy biomes, and are caused by rain.
 * Windy Days
 * Windy Days will add wind, a subtle effect which adds a wind direction, a wind
 * speed, a weather effect that
 * spawns very rare particles above Y=50 that move in the direction of the wind
 * and change speed with the speed of the wind,
 * and a very subtle acceleration in the direction of the wind, depending on the
 * speed of the wind, that effects all items and projectiles.
 * Storms
 * Storms (Terrarian Storms) will be caused by Windy Days being at the same time
 * as Rain, and will act like normal minecraft storms
 * (which get removed) but have Windy Day effects, rain effects, and have a
 * higher chance of lightning.
 * Sandstorms
 * Sandstorms will occur when in a Desert there is a Windy Day. Sandstorms will
 * add the "subtle acceleration" to every single entity above Y=50,
 * including items and projectiles, meaning items and projectiles now have 2x
 * the "subtle acceleration".
 * Sanstorms will also add 2 new enemies, (Antlion and Antlion Swarmer) can have
 * lightning strikes, reduce the light level
 * provided by the sun by 3, and adds sand particles that drift with the wind
 * and fall from the sky.
 * Optional (priority)
 * 1 Add terraria's weather music for Blizzards, Windy Days, Storms, Sandstorms,
 * and Slime Rains.
 * 2 Add Weather Detector item that changes description depending on the weather
 * and weather forecast.
 * 3 Add Slime Rain weather that can happen if you have Terrarian Slimes
 * installed.
 * 
 * Better Time will slightly slow down daytime (not nighttime) by 1.25x, and
 * will reduce normal minecraft hostile mob spawning by 1.05x.
 * (multiply by 0.95)
 * 
 * Shockwaves will add AoE attacks that go through walls and apply the knockback
 * function to all mobs in a (radius size) radius.
